---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.24 (2013.Q3)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed AV issues in Android Projects compiled with Delphi XE5.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.23
---------------------------------------------------------

1) To resolve conflicts with some C++Builder libraries, 
   all "EOF" properties have been renamed to "Eof", and  "BOF" to "Bof".

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.22
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed AV when working with C++ Builder XE4.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.21
---------------------------------------------------------

1) New Android support for Delphi XE5

2) New "SDKDemos_FMX2.bpg" Project group with 
   "fmx2FileClient", "fmx2AppClient" and "fmx2AppServer" Projects.

NOTE: "TRtcMemDateSet" component is NOT compatible with iOS or Android.
Use "TClientDataSet" component with "TRtcDataSetMonitor" instead.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.20
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed Unicode character support in TRtcDataSetMonitor.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.19
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "TRtcDataProvider" component extended with the "OnResponseDone" event.
   This is the last event triggered after the complete Response was sent to the Client.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.18
---------------------------------------------------------

1) When using the WinInet or WinHTTP API, TRtcHttpClients sending requests with content body to the 
   same URI using different content lengths has often resulted in an API error and a disconnect.
   This has now been fixed.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.17
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed XE4 iOS compiler compatibility.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.16 
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Connect and Disconnect methods on the TRtcHttpClient component updated to allow opening and closing 
   the connection directly from RTC events triggered by the TRtcHttpClient component, even if the component
   is being used with MultiThreaded=TRUE. This allows the Client to close the connetion and re-open it directly 
   from a RTC Event, in case the connection has to be "reset" for any reason (like bad response from the Server).

2) Updated WinInet and WinHTTP connection providers to use SOCK_READ_BUFFER_SIZE and SOCK_SEND_BUFFER_SIZE
   global variables from the rtcSockBase unit to set reading and sending buffer sizes.
   This allows you to set different buffer sizes for your Client Applications, while keeping
   buffer sizes uniform across all connection providers (WinSock, WinInet and WinHttp).

   NOTE: To read data in smaller chunks, use the new "Response.ExpectedBytes" property to define how many 
   bytes you want to read next. If that property is 0 (default), maximum buffers will be used for reading.

3) LISTEN_BACKLOG constant in the rtcSynAPI unit changed to a variable, so it can be modified if the Server 
   has to be capable of accepting a very high number of new incoming connections in a very short time.
   Default value is set to 200, which should be enough for most Servers.
