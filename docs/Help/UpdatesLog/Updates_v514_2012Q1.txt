---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v5.14 (2012.Q1)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "RTC_noWideUString" compiler directive added.

  Starting with RTC SDK v5.13, a new "UString" type was introduced, mapping 
  to the "String" type when compiled with Delphi 2009 and later (Unicode),
  but to "WideString" when compiled with FPC or older Delphi versions.

  If you do NOT want the "UString" type to be mapped to a WideString type
  when compiled with  FPC and older Delphi versions, but preffer the old behavior, 
  where "UString" was always euqal to  "String", declare "RTC_noWideUString".

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v5.13
---------------------------------------------------------

1) New type introduced: UString; ("rtcTypes.pas" and "rtcInfo.pas" units)

   When compiled with Delphi 2009 and later, "UString" equals "String" (Unicode String),
   so nothing changes when you are using a fully Unicode-enabled compiler.

   When compiled with older Delphi version (which don't have native Unicode support),
   or with FPC (iOS simulator or device), "UString" type will be mapped to "WideString",
   with all methods, properties and functions which are Unicode-enabled with Delphi 2009 
   and later, become WideString-enabled when compiled with FPC (iOS) or older Delphi versions.

   This change was required to ensure that Unicode strings will always be correctly handled,
   regardless of the platform the app is running on, or the compiler used to compile it.

   A negative side-effect (only for applications compiled with older Delphi versions or FPC)
   might be a slight performance degradation when using Unicode-enabled properties, because 
   the WideString type is NOT refference counted (AnsiString and UnicodeString types are).

   You should also get warnings from the compiler about ambigous type casting, if you have
   been explicitly typecasting results from properties like "asText" to PChar or PAnsiChar,
   because "asText" now returns a WideString when compiled with FPC and older Delphi versions
   instead of a String (=AnsiString on FPC and all older/non-unicode Delphi versions).

2) Fixed Unicode support in the XML-RPC parser and generator.

3) Added JSON parser and generator (full Unicode support) to all TRtcValue objects.

4) "QuickStart/XMLRPCTest" Project extended, so it can now be used for
   testing RTC, XML-RPC as well as the new JSON parser and generator.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v5.12
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed compatibility with Lazarus/FPC on Linux.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v5.11
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Added the "NeedMoreData" method to TRtcTcpClient and TRtcTcpServer components to allow
   the use of raw TCP/IP components on non-Windows platforms (see below for more info).

   For the components to work on non-Windows platforms, your protocol has to follow a strict 
   request/response scheme, or be defined strictly enough for both sides to know when to expect 
   data from the other side and when to send data (at any given point in time, you can either 
   be a dedicated receiver or a dedicated sender, but not both at the same time).

   For raw TCP components to work on non-Windows platforms, you will need to use the "NeedMoreData" 
   method when you are expecting data from the other side. For example, a HTTP Server would call 
   “NeedMoreData” immediately after a client opens a new connection and then again in case the 
   received data doesn’t contain a complete request. A HTTP Client, on the other end, would call 
   “NeedMoreData” after sending a complete request to the Server and then again after receiving 
   some data in case received content doesn’t contain the complete response.

   If your protocol allows sending and receiving at the same time, then you won't be able to
   use raw TCP/IP components from the RTC SDK to implement it for non-Windows platforms.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v5.08 - v5.10
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "DisconnectNow" method added to TRtcHttpClient and TRtcMessageClient components.
   This method calls "Disconnect" and waits for the Client connection to close.

2) "StopListenNow" method added to TRtcHttServer and TRtcMessageServer components.
   This method calls "StopListen" and waits for the Server listener to stop listening.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v5.07
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "RtcPrepareSqlWhere", "RtcSetSqlWhereParams", "RtcPrepareSqlAction" and "RtcSetSqlActionParams" 
   functions added to the "rtcDB" unit to simplify the process of applying Client-side DataSet 
   changes to a Database on the Server. The only requirement is that the Database Engine 
   is SQL-capable and uses the "TParams" class from the "DB" unit to prepare SQL parameters.

2) "BDEDemoServer" Project updated to use new functions from the "rtcDB" unit to build a select 
   query and to apply changes to the Database instead of having custom functions in the main unit.

3) "FishFactServer3" Project added, using new functions from the "rtcDB" unit to apply changes
   to the "biolife" table instead of using a custom "PrepareQueryAction" implementation.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v5.06
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed WideString support in the "TRtcMemDataSet" component for iOS Projects.

2) "FishFactServer" Project extended to convert all "AnsiString" fields to "WideString"
   for testing WideString field type support on different platforms.

3) "FishFacts.data" file updated to use "WideString" fields instead of "AnsiString".

4) "iosTestClient" Project extended to display "Category" and "CommonName" field values.

5) "iosTestClient2" Project added, using TRtcMemDataSet as Client-side dataset and allowing changes
   to be made to "Category" and "CommonName" fields (two Edit fields) and sent to the FishFactServer.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v5.05
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Added [ComponentPlatformsAttribute] for all components registered on the Delphi component palette,
   so the IDE will know which components have support for Win32, Win64 and Mac OSX platforms.
   
   NOTE: This does NOT fix the problem with the Delphi XE2 IDE which filters out RTC SDK components 
   from the component palette (grey) when you create a new or open an existing FireMonkey iOS Project.
   To get around that problem in the Delphi XE2 IDE, you will need to DELETE your Projects ".dproj" 
   file before you can start adding RTC SDK components to your FireMonkey iOS Form or DataModule.
