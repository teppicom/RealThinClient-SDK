---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes since v4.00 (2010.Q3)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "CancelCalls" method added to the TRtcClientModule component, allowing you to cancel
   *all* unsent calls prepared after "StartCalls" and decrement "CallsLevel" to zero (0).

2) When using RTC Client or Server components with MultiThreaded=TRUE, an exception was *sometimes*
   being raised from within a background thread during application shutdown as a result of the thread
   pool still being "up and running" after some objects (which are required by the thread pool) have
   already been destroyed from the finalization section of other units. This has now been fixed.

3) "TimedOut" method added to all TRtcConnection component descendants:
    - TRtcHttpClient, TRtcHttpServer, TRtcISAPIServer, TRtcMessageClient, TRtcMessageServer.
    
   "TimedOut" will return TRUE if a connection was closed (OnDisconnect / OnConnectLost)
   because of a timeout set with the "Timeout" property.

4) Fixed the "change password" feature in the RTC Messenger Server Demo Project.

5) Fixed an AccessViolation in the RTC Messenger Server Demo Project.

6) Added "RTC_INFO" logging for all "toCode" methods.

7) Added more information to ZLib exception messages.

8) Declared a new "ERtcInfo" exception type, which is now used
   for all RTC exceptions raised from the "rtcInfo.pas" unit.

9) ZLib updated to the latest version (1.2.5)
