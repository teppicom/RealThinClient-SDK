*                                                                  *
* RealThinClient SDK v5.04 (2011.Q4), released November 11th 2011. *
*                                                                  *
********************************************************************

RealThinClient SDK v5.0 was the first release with official support for developing 
Mac OSX and iOS Applications using Delphi XE2 and the new FireMonkey platform.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v5.04+ (2011.Q4)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "rtcSDK_C" package updated to work with C++Builder 2009 and later.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v5.04 (2011.Q4)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) There was a problem with "WaitForCompletion" and "Execute" methods in FireMonkey Applications. 
   This has been fixed. To make "WaitForCompletion" and "Execute" methods work with FireMonkey:
     - use the "rtcFMX.GUI" unit in your Windows and Mac OSX FireMonkey Projects
     - use the "rtcFMX_GUI" unit in your iOS FireMonkey Projects

   There is no rule to where the unit should be used, as long as it is compiled into the executable.

2) "rtcVCL_GUI" unit added, so the same feature added to FireMonkey can be used with the VCL.
   When using the rtcVCL_GUI unit, a single "TTimer" component will be used for synchronizing all
   calls from background threads with the Main Thread instead of using the "TThread.Synchronize" method.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v5.03 (2011.Q4)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "ERtcSockException" class devided into:

   * "ERtcSocketError" -> used for normal socket errors and handled silently 
                          by the RTC SDK, based on the "EAbort" class to avoid raising alarms.
                          This exception is used by the RTC SDK to break out of nested method calls
                          and push the error down to the caller, without getting "loud" about it.
                          These errors are expected and will be handled silently by the RTC SDK,
                          triggering all the required events on RTC components to notify the developer.

   * "ERtcFatalSockException" -> used for fatal exceptions, which can NOT be handled by the RTC SDK
                                 and need to raise alarms to notify the developer about a serious problem,
                                 like for example the innability to load WinSock when it was required. 

   This only affects user experience while debugging from within the IDE,
   it does NOT affect the way socket errors are being handled by the RTC SDK.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v5.02 (2011.Q4)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Socket implementations for all platforms (Win32, Win64, OSX and iOS) were updated to use the "OnConnectError" event and
   the "ReconnectOn.ConnectError" property instead of the "OnConnectFail" event and the "ReconnectOn.ConnectFail" property
   if there was a problem connecting to the Server and the last socket API call has returned an error code. Socket error code 
   and description are forwarded to the "OnConnectError" event (E.Message parameter), so they can be used in debugging
   or to display a more informative error message to the user when a connection can not be established.

2) Descriptions for socket errors on the iOS platform fixed.

3) Delphi 6 compatibility fixed.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v5.01 (2011.Q4)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) There was a bug in the AutoConnect feature of the TRtcHttpClient component, which resulted in a temporary Request object 
   to be freed twice if there was an exception raised from the Connect method (for example, when using an invalid Server Address)
   but the "OnConnectError" event was left undefined by the component user. This has now been fixed.
   - Now, Temporary Request Objects will ONLY be freed once, even in case of an unexpected exception
   - The "Connect" method will NOT be raising exceptions if there is a problem connecting to the provided Server Address,
     but ONLY if there is an unexpected condition (property not correctly set or components not correctly linked).
     In case of a Connect Error, any exceptions raised will be caught and handled internally, triggering the "OnConnectError" event.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v5.0 (2011.Q4)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Instructions for making the RTC SDK accessible from XCode (for iOS development) added to the "Readme.txt" file.

2) "FireMonkey_Projects.bpg" Group file split into "FMX_Projects.bpg" and "iOS_Projects.bpg"
 
    "FMX_Projects.bpg" Group contains Projects which can be compiled for Win32, Win64 and Mac OSX platforms
    "iOS_Projects.bpg" Group contains Projects which can be compiled for the iOS platform

3) "Delphi_Projects.bpg" Group file renamed to "VCL_Projects.bpg"

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.62 (RC6 for v5.0)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Added "rtcFMX_GUI" and "rtcFMX.GUI" units to the RTC SDK "Lib" folder.

   The new "rtcFMX_GUI" unit should be used in all RTC iOS Applications which have a GUI (Graphical User Interface), 
   because it implements a method for synchronizing background RTC threads with the Main thread by using a FMX TTimer, 
   which is at least 20 times faster than using the default FPC implementation (it synchronizes only once every second).
   
   The new "rtcFMX.GUI" does the same as "rtcFMX_GUI", but works with FireMonkey for Mac OSX and Windows.
   It is NOT necessary to use the "rtcFMX.GUI" unit for Windows and MacOSX applications because FireMonkey 
   on these platforms handle Thread Synchronization immediately (and not with a one second delay like FPC),
   but the unit is provided for testing and performance comparisons between platforms.

2) FireMonkey Demos for iOS updated to use the "rtcFMX_GUI" unit (this addition visibly improves performance),
   FireMonkey Demos for Mac OSX and Windows updated to use the "rtcFMX.GUI" unit (for testing purposes).
   
---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.61 (RC5 for v5.0)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed abnormal App termination on iOS after a connection loss (caused by unhandled "Broken Pipe" signals).

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.60 (RC4 for v5.0)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed problems with RTC Encryption on iOS.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.59 (RC3 for v5.0)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "LoadFromStream" method added to the "TRtcParse" class in the "rtcParse" unit.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.58 (RC2 for v5.0)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed memory alignment problems with fast strings and the pointer pool when compiled for Win64.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.57 (RC1 for v5.0)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) New compiler directive: "RTC_useWindowsTimers"

   Now, you can decide which rtcTimer implementation you want to use on Windows.

   By default, the new cross-platform rtcTimer (creates 2 background threads) is used,
   utilizing the "Synchronize" method when Timer events need to be executed inside
   the Main thread. This is the recommended setting and works for all platforms.

   But ... if you prefer the OLD implementation which uses Windows Timers when
   compiled for Windows (for example, because it does NOT create ANY background threads),
   you can now declare the "RTC_useWindowsTimers" compiler directive for each Project
   where you want to use the OLD Windows Timer implementation, or ... you can declare 
   it directly inside the "rtcDefs.inc" file ("Lib" folder) in case you want to use 
   the OLD Windows Timer implementation with ALL your Windows Projects.

   NOTE: "RTC_useWindowsTimers" compiler directive has no effect on non-Windows platforms.
   When compiling the RTC SDK for any other platform (like Mac OSX and iOS), the new 
   cross-platform rtcTimer version working with 2 background threads will be used,
   even if the "RTC_useWindowsTimers" compiler directive is declared.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.56
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed a bug in TRtcClientModule which was causing RTC Encryption to 
   get "out of sync" if a connection dropped but AutoRepost was NOT used.

2) Fixed a memory alignment problem with sorted lists and binary search trees.

3) RTC Thread Pooling mechanism optimized and "TRtcThread" class cleaned up:
  - "Pause" and "Resume" methods removed from all components using them
  - "PostJob" method updated to accept a "TObject" instead of an untyped var
  - "Work" method changed to "RunJob", parameters moved to local variables
  - "Kill" method changed to "KillJob", parameters moved to local variables
  - all components and classes using RTC Thread Pooling mechanism updated

4) Added finalization to the "rtcTimer" unit for a clean application shutdown.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.55
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "DelphiDataSetToRtc" function updated to use TDataSet's "Fields" property instead 
   of "FieldDefs" in order to copy calculated and lookup fields when "OnlyDataFields=False".
   
   Field order will now also be preserved, while Data Fields which have manually been removed 
   from the DataSet (using the Field Editor in the IDE, for example) will NOT be copied.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.54
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "DelphiDataSetToRtc" function extended with a "OnlyDataFields" parameter (default=True),
   so it can be used for copying ONLY data fields (default) or ALL fields from a DataSet.

   Naturally, anyone has complex requirements can simply copy that complete function and 
   write their own version in their own unit, since it is NOT used by the RTC SDK. 
   It is just a simple utility function provided for your own convenience.

2) "TRtcResult" component extended with a new "PreparingCall" event, which (if assigned)
   will be called with the "Data" parameter before a remote call is prepared for sending.
   
   Using the "PreparingCall" event, you can modify all remote call parameters before the
   call is sent to the Server, or ... you can completely skip any remote call before it
   is sent to the Server by setting "Data.isNull:=True;" from the "PreparingCall" event.

3) Master/Detail Database Access Client examples (MasterDetailClient + MasterDetailClient2)
   updated to use the new "PreparingCall" event on the "TRtcResult" component for skipping
   remote calls after moving away from rows. This way, performance while scrolling through
   a master dataset is improved, without using the old and risky implementation which 
   was skipping all requests as long as there were no "submit" request in the queue. 

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.53
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "Ping" events on the TRtcClientModule component are now executed from a background 
   thread when AutoSyncEvents=False and the connection component is MultiThreaded.

2) There was a bug in the low-level async WinSock API layer, which could have resulted 
   in a connection component to stop reconnecting after a failed connect attempt,
   leaving the connection component in an undefined state. This has now been fixed.

3) "RTCWebServer" Demo did to compile "out-of-the-box" on Delphi 2005 - 2010,
   because of a missing search path to PHP Data Provider units. This has now been fixed.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.51 & v4.52
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Problems in the Low-level Asynchronous WinSock implementation, which resulted in 
   higher than usual UDP datagram loss and TCP/IP connection loss, have now been fixed.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.50
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Introducing a new, cross-platform implementation of the "TRtcTimer" class.

   While the original "TRtcTimer" class implementation was using Windows Handles and Timers
   running in the Main Thread, the new implementation used two background threads and Events,
   one thread for Timers executing in the Main Thread and another thread for Timers running
   in threads handled by the RTC Thread Pool. This ensures that background Timers will always
   be executed for Multi-Threaded connections, even if the main thread is being blocked.

   NOTE: When running on iOS, because FireMonkey handles synchronization between background 
   threads and the main thread in 1 second intervals, when TRtcTimer is used in single threaded 
   mode (TRtcHttpClient.MultiThreaded=False), it has a precision of max 1 second. On all other
   platforms (Win32, Win64, Mac OSX), TRtcTimer precision is set to 50 ms (20 times per second).

2) "RtcDataSetRowsToDelphi", "DelphiDataSetToRtc" and "DelphiRowToRtc" procedures
   from the "rtcDB.pas" unit updated to support TBCD and TSQLTimeStamp fields.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.49
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "TRtcTimer" class update to use 64bit parameters when compiled for 64bit Windows.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.48
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "TRtcMemDataSet" component ("rtcDB.pas" unit) is now also available for iOS.

   To avoid FPC compile errors when using the "TRtcMemDataSet" component, you will need
   to manually change the "uses" clauses in your Units to use the "DB" unit and NOT "Data.DB".

   You won't be able to directly link fields from a "TRtcMemDataSet" component to visual 
   FireMonkey components (like you can with FireMonkey OSX Apps), because FireMonkey for iOS
   does NOT have Live Bindings support (yet), but ... you can use the "TRtcMemDataSet" 
   component directly in code and implement the "OnDataChange" event to monitor and extract 
   changes for sending to the RTC Server, just like you can for Windows and OSX Applications.
   This way, your RTC Server can handle changes received from iOS Clients the same way it
   handles changes received from Windows or Max OSX Clients (see "TRtcDataSetChanges" class).

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.47
---------------------------------------------------------

1) C++Builder package (rtcSDK_C.bpk & rtcSDK_C.cpp) updated.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.46
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "FishFactServer2" and "BDEDemoServer" Projects fixed to support all field types.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.45
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "rtcDB.pas" unit fixed to compile with FPC.

2) "iosTestClient" Project updated to use only required units.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.44
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "DelphiDataSetToRTC" function updated to skip TGraphicField Header information, 
    so that Graphic fields can be used on Clients independently of a Server-side Database.

2) "FishFactClient", "FishFactClient2" and "fmxFishFactClient" Projects from the 
   "DB_Access" folder extended to allow uploading new images to the "Graphic" field.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.43
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "iOSTestClient" Project extended to keep the received DataSet in a separate variable
   and allow scrolling through DataSet rows using First, Next, Prior and Last buttons
   while displaying the image stored inside the selected row.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.42
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed Logging functions for non-Windows platforms ("rtcLog.pas" unit).

2) "TRtcQuickJob" component added. This new component can be used to quickly implement background 
   jobs, without having to manually create threads and without having to worry about too many threads.

   Simply implement the "OnExecute" event, set the "AccessGUI" property to TRUE if the event has
   to access any GUI elements and you can call the OnExecute event from anywhere by using the 
   "Post" method, which is available on the "TRtcQuickJob" component. 

3) "PostQuickJob" procedure added, which can be used to quickly implement jobs by using events
   instead of the "TRtcQuickJob" component. This is an alternative to the "TRtcQuickJob" component.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.41
---------------------------------------------------------

1) New FireMonkey versions of the "App_Server" Demo Project:

   - "Demos\App_Server\fmxAppServer.dpr" (MacOSX + Win32 + Win64)
   - "Demos\App_Server\iosAppServer.dpr" (iOS + Win32)

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.40
---------------------------------------------------------

1) New FireMonkey versions of the "File_Client" Demo Project:

   - "Demos\File_Client\fmxFile_Client.dpr" (MacOSX + Win32 + Win64)
   - "Demos\File_Client\iosFile_Client.dpr" (iOS + Win32)

2) New FireMonkey versions of the "App_Client" Demo Project:

   - "Demos\App_Client\fmxAppClient.dpr" (MacOSX + Win32 + Win64)
   - "Demos\App_Client\iosAppClient.dpr" (iOS + Win32)

3) New Project Group "FireMonkey_Projects.bpg" added to the "Demos" folder,
   containing all RTC Demo Projects for the new FireMonkey platform.

4) New batch file "_makeXCodeProjects.cmd" added to the "Demos" folder, using which
   you can create "XCode" files for ALL "iOS" Projects available in the "Demos" folder.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.39
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Compatibility update for the XCode 4 debugger running on the iOS device.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.38
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "TRtcMemDataSet" component extended to support more field types.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.37
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "MasterDetailClient2" project added to the "Demos\DB_Access" folder.

  This Project shows how to write a RTC Client using DB-aware components with
  3rd-party in-memory DataSets (like TClientDataSet) in Master/Detail relations.
 
  It is designed to work together with the "BDEDemoServer" Project for remote 
  access the the "DBDEMOS" Database and uses asynchronous communication with 
  TClientDataSet (in-memory DataSet) and TRtcDataSetMonitor (monitor changes) components.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.36
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Improved Client side request handling to allow preparing and posting a new 
   remote function call from inside the "OnReturn" event in single-threaded as
   well as multi-threaded mode, without using the "FromInsideEvent" parameter.

2) "MasterDetailClient" project added to the "Demos\DB_Access" folder.

  This Project shows how to write a RTC Client using DB-aware components with
  DataSets in Master/Detail relations. This Client is designed to work together
  with the "BDEDemoServer" Project for remote access the the "DBDEMOS" Database.
 
  This project uses asynchronous communication and the TRtcMemDataSet component.
