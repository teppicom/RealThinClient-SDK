****************************************************************

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.15 (2013.Q2)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed a problem in the TRtcHttpServer component which could have caused an 
   endless loop when reading Request content sent with Chunked Transfer Encoding.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.14
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed a problem in the "rtcLog" unit which caused the "LOG" folder to be created 
   directly under the root directory ("C:/") and the log file name to be set to ".LOG"
   if the RTC_DEBUG compiler directive was declared (used for RTC DEBUG logging).

2) Reduced WinInet and WinHTTP input buffers from 30KB to 16KB for 
   improved reading performance and better bandwidth control.

3) DisconnectNow(TRUE) updated to call "SkipRequests" if the connection is already closed,
   to keep the results identical to calling DisconnectNow(TRUE) when the connection is open.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.13
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed problems in the rtcTimer and rtcThrPool units, which could have resulted in
   Applications using RTC Timers and/or Threads to wait up to 20 seconds before closing.

2) RTC WebServer Demo updated to work a Windows Service with StreamSec Tools 2.1 (SSL encryption).
   You need to have StreamSec Tools 2.1 or 2.2 installed in Delphi, and declare the 
   compiler directive "StreamSecII" to compile the RTC WebServer Demo with SSL support.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.12
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Optimized WinInet and WinHTTP connection providers to reduce API calls to 1 (where possible)
   and fixed a bug which could have caused the first request content chunk to be sent twice,
   or the internal content length counters to get out-of-sync and start causing problems
   when sending request content body in smaller pieces using the WinInet or WinHTTP APIs
   (for example: when the "useProxy", "useSSL" or "useWinHTTP" property is set to TRUE).

2) Added "ExpectedBytes" property to the "Response" object on the TRtcHttpClient
   component to make it possible to read custom formatted input binary streams.

NOTE: Delphi XE4 iOS support is still in BETA.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.11 (BETA)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Replaced all "TList" declarations with a new TObjectList class (TList<TObject>)
   to fix problems caused by ARC (Automatic Refference Counting), where objects 
   inside a List where auto-destroyed when their original pointers went out of scope.

2) Fixed a compile error in the rtcZLib unit (compression and decompression)

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.10 (BETA)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) First RTC SDK version which compiles with Delphi XE4 and shows the
   first signs of functionality on the iOS Simulator and the iOS Device.

   There have been a LOT of changes in this release (over 50 files) and
   a number of them will probably have an effect on other platforms as well,
   so ... do NOT use this release for your production environments!
