Here is a complete list of changes since v3.83 (2010.Q2):

1) Fixed a compatibility problem with FPC/Lazarus on MacOSX ("rtcConn.pas" unit).

2) "PostEvent" method added to the "TRtcConnection" component, which can be used for 
   posting a job to a connection component to call the provided "TRtcNotifyEvent" with 
   the connection component as a "Sender" parameter from within the thread associated 
   with the connection component.

3) Added properties and methods to allow manually controlled reading from socket-based connections.
   For more info, check the new "ManualRead" property on "TRtcClientResponse" and "TRtcServerRequest" 
   classes and the "AfterManualRead" method added to the "TRtcConnection" (base connection) component.

4) Improved HTTP/1.0 and "Connection: close" support.

5) Minor update of the File_Client demo to discard reading buffers when 
   downloading files without using the option to store the contents into a file
   and display only the contents of the first received data block in memo.

6) Minor formatting improvements in the HELP file.

7) "RTC_LOG_DATETIMEFORMAT" global variable added to the "rtcLog.pas" unit, allowing you to specify the
   string used to format the Data/Time output in LOG files created by using "Log" and "XLog" functions.
   
8) Default Data/Time format for RTC LOG files extended to include milliseconds: 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:nn:ss.zzz; ';

9) Minor Server-side socket-based connection provider improvements.

10) RTC Value Objects used for RTC Remote Functions and RTC Scripting extended to support all 
    Delphi Database Field types available in all Delphi versions up to Delphi 2010.

11) "rtcDBTypes.pas" unit extended with support for newly added Database Field types.

12) RTC Logging ("rtcLog.pas" unit) extended with support for optional buffered (in-memory) logging, 
    which makes it possible to use RTC Logging in scenarios where Performance is an important factor 
    and writing every log entry directly to a file would generate too high performance penalty.

   Functions added in the "rtcLog.pas" unit: 

     - StartLogBuffers(MaxSize:longint);
     - DumpLogBuffers;
     - StopLogBuffers;

   When using RTC Log Buffers, all Log and XLog calls will store Log entries to in-memory buffers 
   instead of directly writing every log entry to a file. All Log and XLog calls will be buffered 
   to memory until total buffered log size exceeds specified maximum log buffer size in 
   "StartLogBuffers" or until you call DumpLogBuffers or StopLogBuffers.

   StartLogBuffers will start using buffers for logging and set maximum buffer size (bytes).
   If log buffers were already enabled, StartLogBuffers will dump current log buffers to 
   files and set new maximum buffer size.

   DumpLogBuffers will dump current log buffers to files.

   StopLogBuffers will dump current log buffers to files and disable buffers for logging.

13) AppClient and AppServer demos extended with "API Timouets" and "RTC Timeouts" checkboxes.

14) There was a bug in the "Mime_Decode" function because of which data received using the 
    rtc_ByteStream data type with the XML-RPC format was not always correctly decoded 
    (sometimes the last few bytes were missing). This has now been fixed.

15) Added "RTC_LOG_THREADID" global variable to the "rtcLog.pas" unit. When RTC_LOG_THREADID 
   is set to TRUE (default=FALSE), each call to the Log() or XLog() function will add the 
   current Thread ID before Date and Time to every Log entry.

16) Using "Request.Skip" after data was already sent through a Client connection could have 
   resulted in the next Request from the Request Queue to be posted before the connection 
   was Reset (by closing the old and opening a new connection), which would raise the 
   exception "Last header intercepted with new header, before data sent out.". 
   This has now been fixed.

17) Added all "mem*.pas" units to the DPK file.

18) There was a bug in "Utf8Decode" and "Utf8DecodeEx" functions (used in RTC remote functions) 
    which could have resulted in 1 byte of memory to get overwritten. This has now been fixed.

19) Improved handling of exceptions inside "mem*" object constructors.

20) "DoWaitForCompletion" with "AllowMessageProcessing=False" and "Timeout=0" 
    was using a 100ms timeout instead of infinite. This has now been fixed.

21) "Cookie" properties on TRtcRequest and TRtcResponse classes were not being updated 
    correctly after a new "HeaderText" was assigned. This has now been fixed.

22) Fixed XML-RPC type name for data/time fields.

23) "rtc2DBTypes.pas" unit added to the "Lib" folder with new (future-proof)
   implementations of RTC_DB2FIELD_TYPE and RTC_FIELD2DB_TYPE functions.

24) "rtcDBTypes.pas" unit in the "Demos/DataProvider" folder updated to use the 
   new RTC_DB2FIELD_TYPE and RTC_FIELD2DB_TYPE functions from the "rtc2DBTypes.pas" unit.

25) "DelphiDataSetToRtc" function in the "rtcDBTypes.pas" unit updated to support TBlobField types.

26) "TRtcDataRouter" and "TRtcLoadBalancer" components added to the component palette.
    These new components allow you to easily route requests from your Server to one or more 
    other Servers and make it easy to write HTTP(S) Routers, Proxy Servers and Load Balancers.

27) "Router", "Router2", "LoadBalancer", "LoadBalancer2" and "LoadBalancer3" projects added 
    to the Demos folder, showing you how to use the "TRtcDataRouter" and "TRtcLoadBalancer" 
    components to write a HTTP(S) Router or Load Balancer.

28) "RouterCheck" project added to the "Tools" folder. This small tool can be
    used to check "RTC Router" and "RTC Load Balancer" log files for consistency.
