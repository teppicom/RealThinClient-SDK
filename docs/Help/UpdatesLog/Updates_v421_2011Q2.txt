* RealThinClient SDK v4.21 (2011.Q2) June 13th 2011. *
*                                                    *
******************************************************

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.21
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "ObjectLinks" property on TRtcClientModule and TRtcServerModule components extended
   with options for automatic Object Manager creation without using a single line of code.

2) Minor updates to some Demos.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.20 - BETA
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed a memory leak in the "TRtcRemoteObjectManager" when Objects managed
   by the Object Manager are being destroyed from Object Manager's destructor.
   
2) "FreeObjects" method added to "TRtcObjectManager" class, which can be used to Free
   ALL objects managed by the Object Manager, without destroying the Object Manager.
   
3) "TRtcClientModule" component extended with a new property called "AutoSessionsPing",
   which implements automated Session PING-ing by activating a Timer when there is an
   active Session, which will make sure that a remote "PING" call is sent to the Server
   if there were no other remote calls made in the past "AutoSessionsPing" seconds,
   in order to keep the Server informed that the Client is "alive" and keeping
   Clients Session on the Server alive - without writing a single line of code.

   Each PING call is made by injecting a remote function call and you have the
   option to decide how that remote function call will look like if you implement
   the "OnPing" event on the "TRtcClientModule". Results received after a "PING"
   call will be received in the "OnPingResult" event. And if the remote PING call
   was aborted (for what ever reason), the "OnPingAborted" event will be triggered.

   "OnPing", "OnPingResult" and "OnPingAborted" events are optional (do NOT have to
   be implemented). If they are NOT implemented, a simple NULL value will be sent
   to the Server for each "PING" call and NULL will be returned as a Result.

4) "TRtcServerModule" and "TRtcClientModule" components extended to have the Client-side
   Session closed automatically if a Session is closed manually on the Server-side.

5) TRtcServerModule's "ActivateObjectManager" method updated to automatically create
   a new Session if called with "xCreate=True" and no Session was active.

6) Behavior of the "ObjectLinks" property with "ol_Auto" setting fixed.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.19 - BETA
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "CheckType" method added to RTC Value Objects in addition to the "isType" property.

   The "isType" property always returns the *exact* type of data stored inside
   a RTC Value Object, but some types are NOT supported by all transfer formats
   in which case one type might be recognized as a similar type on the receiver side.
   To avoid manually checking for all compatible types, the "CheckType" method
   was added, which receives a type as parameter and returns TRUE if the Value
   stored inside the RTC Value Object can be accessed using that type (parameter).

   For example, using "CheckType(rtc_OID)" on a TRtcValue instance will return
   TRUE if the Value stored in the TRtcValue instance can be read using "asOID".
   Because only the RTC Format supports all data types natively, but XML and other
   formats do NOT, using the new "CheckType" method makes it easy to check if the
   Value received is compatible with the value expected, even if they are NOT of
   the exact same type (without having to manually check all compatible types).

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.18 - BETA
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "FindObject" and "FindOID" methods added to TRtcObjectManager,
   TRtcCustomObjectLink and TRtcLinkedModule components/classes.

2) "rtc_LinkedObject" type renamed to "rtc_OID" and "asOID" properties
   added to all RTC Value Objects in addition to "asLinkedObject".
   
   The main advantage of "asOID" over "asLinkedObject" is that "asOID"
   does NOT require an Object Manager to be set for the current thread,
   while "asLinkedObject" relies on the "GetRtcObjectManager" function
   to find the current thread's Object Manager and uses "FindOID" and/or
   "FindObject" to convert TObject instances to Object IDs and vice-versa.

3) "Manager:TRtcObjectManager" property added to "TRtcObjectCall" class to
   eliminate the need for using the "GetRtcObjectManager" function from events
   and methods which have been triggered/executed by an Object Manager.

4) "TRtcObjectLink" constructor extended with a mandatory "xManager:TRtcObjectManager"
   parameter to make it possible to create Linked Objects even if there is no default
   Object Manager set - provided the component being created knows its Object Manager.

5) "TRtcDirectObjectManager" class removed (use "TRtcLocalObjectManager" class instead).

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.17 - BETA
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed the "WaitForCompletion" method for non-Windows platforms (FPC).

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.16 - BETA
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "TRtcClientModule" and "TRtcServerModule" components updated to allow the creation
   of "RTC Linked Objects" on the Server, on the Client or on both sides (if necessary).
   
   * TRtcClientModule changes:
     - replaced the "AutoLinkObjects" property (true/false; default=false)
       with a new "ObjectLinks" property (ol_Disabled/ol_Manual/ol_Auto; default=ol_Disabled)
     - made the "RemoveObjectManager" method public
     - made the "GetObjectManager" method public
     - added a new public method "ActivateObjectManager"

   * TRtcServerModule changes:
     - replaced the "AutoLinkObjects" property (true/false; default=false)
       with a new "ObjectLinks" property (ol_Disabled/ol_Manual/ol_Auto; default=ol_Disabled)

  For more information on the purpose and meaning behind these changes, please check the
  explanation of these new properties and methods in the Help file or directly in source code.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.15 - BETA
---------------------------------------------------------

1) More "fine-tuning" to simplify the use of "RTC Linked Objects" methods and events.

2) Fixed a memory leak in the TRtcClientModule when using "Linked Objects"
   (caused by the Object Manager not being destroyed with TRtcClientModule).

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.14 - BETA
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Introducing a new "TRtcLinkedModule" component (find it in the "rtcLink.pas" unit),
   which can be dropped on a TDataModule, TForm or TFrame to make it a "RTC Linked Object".

   This new component makes the process of writing linked Data Modules and Forms easy,
   because it gives you all the methods you need to communicate with the remote side
   and provides you with all the events you need to process received data, without having
   to implement your own custom classes. Just drop the component inside the container which
   you want to be able to control remotely, implement provided events using the Delphi IDE
   and use provided methods to communicate with your "counterpart" on the other side,
   without dropping any other component from the RTC SDK on the Form or Data Module.

   For Data Modules and Forms which you want to create in code, the "RemoteClass" property
   has to be correctly set or the remote instance won't be created. The correct value is,
   obviously, the "xClassName" value which you will be checking for in the "OnObjectCreate"
   event on the remote side to create the remote instance, or ... the "xClassName" for
   which you have registered a global RTC Linked Object Constructor on the remote side
   (see "RegisterRtcObjectConstructor" and "UnregisterRtcObjectConstructor" in "rtcInfo.pas").

2) Introducing a new "TRtcCustomObjectLink" class (see "rtcLink.pas" unit),
   which simplifies the process of writing custom "RTC Linked Object" classes by
   providing the same easy-to-use interface as the "TRtcLinkedModule" component.
   
3) A number of changes were made to the general definition of "RTC Linked Objects"
   (calling conventions, constructors, properties and event definitions) to
   further simplify the process of writing custom "RTC Linked Object" classes.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.13 - BETA
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Added a new "OnObjectCreate" event to "TRtcClientModule" and "TRtcServerModule"
   components, which can be used for creating Linked Objects which don't have a
   registered RTC Object Constructor, or to prevent the creation of Objects if the
   user sending the request doesn't have sufficient rights to create such objects.

2) Extended RTC Object Constructor definition with a new "Sender:TObject" parameter.
   When used with TRtcClientModule and TRtcServerModule components, this parameter will
   hold the TRtcConnection component which has received the "construction request".

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.12 - BETA
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed some bugs in the new "RTC Linked Object" feature.

2) Added two new events to "TRtcClientModule" and "TRtcServerModule" components
   for monitoring traffig generated by the new "RTC Linked Objects" feature:

  property OnObjectDataIn:TRtcFunctionPrepareEvent;

    - This event is triggered when data is received from a remote "Object Manager".
      The main purpose of this event is to allow you to *monitor* all received "Linked Objects"
      packages without changing anything, but it could also be used to modify received data
      before it is forwarded to the local "Object Manager" for processing/execution.
      @param(Sender - NIL, or the connection component through which data was received)
      @param(Data - Data received from the remote "Object Manager".
             Unless you know exactly what you are doing and understand the format which
             local and remote "Object Manager" instances are using for communication,
             it is highly recommended that you do NOT make ANY changes to this instance.
             This is the instance that will be passed over to our "Object Manager" later)

  property OnObjectDataOut:TRtcFunctionPrepareEvent;

    - This event is triggered *before* we send data prepared by our "Object Manager".
      The main purpose of this event is to allow you to *monitor* all "Linked Objects"
      packages before they are sent out, but it could also be used to modify prepared data.
      @param(Sender - NIL if using the default connection; "Sender" parameter for the Call method)
      @param(Data - Data prepared by our local "Object Manager" for sending to remote "Object Manager".
             Unless you know exactly what you are doing and understand the format which
             local and remote "Object Manager" instances are using for communication,
             it is highly recommended that you do NOT make ANY changes to this instance.
             This is the instance that will be sent over to remote "Object Manager")

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.11 - BETA
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "ConsolAppCli" Project added to the "Tools\UnitTesting" folder for
   testing the use of RTC Client components inside Console applications.
   (Use together with "AppServer" from the "Demos\AppServer" folder)

2) NexusDB Transport Plugin updated.
   
3) Introducing a new "Linked Objects" feature (BETA, work-in-progress):

   - "TRtcClientModule" and "TRtcServerModule" components have been extended
     with a new "AutoLinkObjects" property, which (when set to TRUE)
     should make sure that any "Linked Objects" created from remote
     functions on the Server will get created on the Client and let
     these two "Linked Objects" keep each other "synchronized".

   - RTC Value types have been extended with a new "rtc_LinkedObject" type
     (along with a new set of "asLinkedObject" properties), which can be
     used to send and receive refferences to "RTC Linked Objects".

   - "TRtcObjectLink", "TRtcObjectManager" and a few other descendants
     of the above two classes have been added ("rtcInfo.pas"/"rtcLinks.pas" units)
     to make the process of implementing "Linked Object" classes as easy
     as possible, while keeping the actual class implementations
     100% independent of communication channels and protocols.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.10
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Introducing two new Generic search classes:

   "rtcSrcList.pas"
   - tRtcSearchList<itemType,infoType>=class(TObject);
   
   "rtcSrcTree.pas"
   - tRtcSearchTree<itemType,infoType>=class(TObject);

   NOTE: These classes are NOT directly used by the RTC SDK. To use them
   you will need Delphi 2009 or later (Generics were introduced in D2009).

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v4.09
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Experimental support for compiling 64bit Windows applications with FPC/Lazarus.
