---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes since v4.05 (2010.Q4)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "rtcSDK_Raw.dpk" package was added ("Lib" folder). This new package can be used
   to register "TRtcTCPClient", "TRtcTCPServer", "TRtcUDPClient" and "TRtcUDPServer"
   components to the Delphi component palette ("RTC Raw" tab).

   Using raw TCP or UDP components from the RTC SDK requires A LOT MORE coding
   and careful design. With raw TCP and UDP components, data is sent and received
   without any kind of pre-formatting (what you see is what you get), so you
   can't combine them with other RTC SDK components to simplify data processing.
   
   As with other RTC SDK components, you also have to ensure that access to all
   component methods (Read/Write) is ONLY done from within the thread responsible
   for each component. For example, if your Client or Server are Multi-Threaded,
   you need to use the PostJob method to post a job to the thread responsible for
   working with that connection component (you can't send data from anywhere).

   * IMPORTANT NOTE *
   The main reason for these components to exist in the RTC SDK is to allow you to
   use the RTC SDK for communicating with third-party Clients and Servers which do
   NOT have support for HTTP/S, but instead use their custom TCP or UDP protocols.

   By using these raw communication components, you acknowledge that we can NOT
   provide you with support for implementing your or any other 3rd-party protocol,
   nor can we assist you in debugging if there should be problems in communication.

2) "Raw_TCP" and "Raw_UDP" example projects added to the "Demos" folder.

   "Raw_TCP" is a very simple project, showing basic usage of the "TRtcTCPClient"
   and "TRtcTCPServer" components to send and receiving raw data over TCP/IP.
   
   "Raw_UDP" is a very simple project, showing basic usage of the "TRtcUDPClient"
   and "TRtcUDPServer" components to send, broadcast and receiving UDP packets.

3) "rtcPHP.pas", "rtcPHPProvider.pas" and "rtcPHPTypes.pas" units
   in "Demos/DataProviders" updated for use with newer PHP versions.

   Depending on the PHP version you want to use,
   you need to declare the correct compiler directive:

   {$DEFINE PHP5} // declare for PHP 5.0 - tested with PHP 5.0.3
   {$DEFINE PHP520} // declare for PHP 5.2 - tested with PHP 5.2.17

   * IMPORTANT NOTE *
   PHP units included in the RTC SDK are purely experimental.
   If you use these units to host PHP sites from a RTC Server,
   you acknowledge that we can NOT provide you with support,
   since these units heavily rely on 3rd-party code.

4) All "HTTP_" variable names sent to PHP script will now be converted to
   upper-case, so that checking $_SERVER[''HTTP_USER_AGENT'] in PHP script
   will now return the correct value of the 'User-Agent' HTTP Header.
   
5) "rtcZLib.pas" unit extended with the option for using the "ZLib.pas" unit
   from Delphi (2009+) internally, instead of a RTC-specific implementation
   which requires external OBJ files compiled for each platform (zlib folder).
