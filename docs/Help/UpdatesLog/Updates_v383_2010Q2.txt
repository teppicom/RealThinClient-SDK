---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 383
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Minor update to *minimize* the possibility of AVs during shutdown, even
   if connections were NOT closed before the application was terminated.

   To *eliminate* AVs during shutdown, you should *always* close RTC connections *before* terminating 
   your RTC applications. Otherwise, an active RTC connection object *could* continue being used from 
   a background thread during shutdown, from where an event could be triggered which could try using
   objects that have already been destroyed during finalization, which would (as expected) raise an AV.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 382
---------------------------------------------------------

1) HTTP/S Header value names and Query parameter names were being 
   automatically converted to UPPERCASE. This has now been fixed.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 381
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Added "public" directive in one class inside rtcPlugins.pas unit.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 380
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Minor performance optimizations.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 379
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Added native support for the Cardinal (LongWord) data type to RTC Remote Functions and Scripting Engine.

   "TRtcCardinalValue" is the class used for storing and handing Cardinal values,
   "rtc_Cardinal" is the new type received from "isType" and
   "asCardinal" is the property used to get and set Cardinal values.

2) AppClient demo extended to include the new Cardinal data type in the flood test.

3) "Windows" unit added to the uses clause of the "rtcParser" unit when compiled for Windows.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 378
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Example Database Pool class implementation is now available in the "Demos\DataProviders\rtcIBODBPool.pas" unit.

   Please note that this unit is NOT used by the RealThinClient SDK nor any RTC SDK Demos and was added only 
   as a simple example which you can use as a starting point for writing your own Database Connection Pool.

   The unit was written by Gerhard Knapp, who is a long-time RTC SDK user and the implementation is specific 
   to IBO components, so you will NOT be able to compile it if you do NOT have IBO components installed. 
   Chances are also that you will NOT be able to compile it even if you have the latest IBO components 
   installed, because the unit will NOT be actively maintained to continue working with future IBO versions.

2) Moved the "rtcDBTypes.pas" unit from "Lib" to "Demos\DataProviders" folder to avoid confusion.

   Just like the new "rtcIBODBPool.pas" unit, the "rtcDBTypes.pas" unit is NOT used by the RealThinClient SDK.

   The unit includes two example functions which show you how data *could* be copied from a TRtcDataSet to 
   a TDataSet and back, but it is ONLY a very simplified example which will most likely not work with all 
   TDataSet components and might not be able to handle all data types used by your TDataSet component.

   If you want to copy data from a TDataSet to a TRtcDataSet and back, you *should* write
your own
   functions for that purpose or directly use TRtcDataSet value objects with RTC remote functions.

   Do NOT use the "rtcDBTypes" unit directly from your projects, as it is ONLY an example (a demo).


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 377
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Added "public" directive to classes where the public section was implicit.

   For example, this code:

     type
       TMyRtcClass = class(TObject)
         myvar:boolean;
         end;

   was changed to this:

     type
       TMyRtcClass = class(Tobject)
       public // <- added
         myvar:boolean;
         end;

   This does NOT change the functionality, but it does guarantee the code will
   compile with the latest Delphi compiler update and all unofficial fixes.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 376
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Connection status checks added to Read and Write methods on the TRtcConnection component to
   prevent exceptions if a connection was terminated (reset by peer) while executing a RTC event.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 375
---------------------------------------------------------

1) AppClient demo was missing code required to wait for connections to
   close before components are being destroyed, which has sometimes caused
   the components to be destroyed while still in use.

2) Clean shutdown code added to the AppClient demo's OnCloseQuery event,
   allowing the AppClient demo to be closed even if a flood test is running.

3) TRtcConnection component updated to stop reconnecting after a Disconnect 
   call if AutoConnect is FALSE, even when the old HTTP/1.0 protocol is used.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 374
---------------------------------------------------------

1) New constructor for TRtcCryptClient and TRtcCryptServer classes.

2) All classes declared as "= class" changed to "= class(TObject)"

3) RTC_EXTDEBUG compiler directive added for extended Session destructor debugging.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 373
---------------------------------------------------------

1) RTC Thread Pool shutdown update.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 372
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Extended RTC_DEBUG logging in the "DoneSessions" procedure.

2) TRtcCrypt class constructor and destructor updated.

3) AppServer demo updated.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 371
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "RtcDataSetToDelphi" function from the "rtcDBTypes.pas" unit fixed.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 370
---------------------------------------------------------

1) A few minor performance optimizations.

2) Updated some comments.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 369
---------------------------------------------------------

1) A number of performance optimizations.

2) "rtcTrashcan.pas" unit removed from all RTC SDK units uses clauses and
   all RTC SDK units finalization sections which have been relying on the 
   RTC garbage collector were updated to work without the garbage collector.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 368
---------------------------------------------------------

1) ".SOCK.log" file, which will be generated when LOG_SOCKET_ERRORS is TRUE and
   the async WinSock connection provider is being used, has now been extended
   to also include the peer (remote) address and port number, where available.

2) "LOG_COMMON_SOCKET_ERRORS" global variable added as an extension to "LOG_SOCKET_ERRORS".

  Common socket errors are errors which are expected to happen if your network
  is under heavy load, or if your clients are accessing your server over the internet.
  Logging these errors could result in your "SOCK.log" file to grow rapidly and is
  recommended ONLY if your Clients are running from inside LAN and you want to 
  test if your Network can handle the load without a single connection getting 
  aborted, or connection attempts timing out of being refused by the server.

  By default, "LOG_COMMON_SOCKET_ERRORS" will be FALSE even if the RTC_DEBUG 
  compiler directive is declared. When "LOG_COMMON_SOCKET_ERRORS" is FALSE,
  "Connection aborted" messages filtered out for the "FD_CLOSE" event and
  "Connection refused" messages filtered out for the "FD_CONNECT" event in
  the ".SOCK.log" file to reduce log file size and make it easier to spot 
  problems instead of having a LOG file cluttered with very common entries.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 367
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed memory leaks generated by calling "TRtcHttpServer.Listen" after
   an exception was raised from the last "TRtcHttpServer.Listen" call.

   For example, trying to Listen on a Port which is already in use
   would raise an exception. Changing the Port number and using Listen
   again would result in pointers to objects created in the 1st Listen
   call to be overwritten by new objects of the same type instead of
   the old objects being destroyed first. This has now been fixed.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 366
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Notification methods implemented on all RTC components.

   In prior RTC SDK versions, it was a very bad idea to remove a component
   from a Form or DataModule at design-time if it was being referenced by
   another RTC component, because that would have generated Access Violations
   when Delphi would try to save the Form or DataModule afterwards because the
   old component reference would remain in all components referencing it.

   This has now been fixed, so it is now safe to simply remove a component
   from a Form or DataModule even if it was referenced by another component,
   because all components will now be notified about other component removals
   and will be removing their references to the component(s) being removed.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 365
---------------------------------------------------------

1) The OnDataSent event was NOT being triggered on the TRtcDataRequest component
   when using the asynchronous (non-blocking) WinSock connection provider and 
   the request was being sent out in several steps (not in one Write operation).

   This has now been fixed.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 364
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "Uses" clauses of all RTC SDK units cleaned up to list only required units.

    Please note that this update does NOT change the RTC SDK functionality.

    Depending on the order some units are listed in your projects, it *could*
    affect the order in which RTC units are being initialized and finalized.
    In very rare cases, it could also result in some units to NOT be compiled
    into your projects EXE file and thus slightly reduce the size of the EXE.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 363
---------------------------------------------------------

1) A few optional AnsiString methods which could be used as alternatives to the standard 
   String methods for accessing elements inside a TRtcRecord, TRtcDataSet and TRtcFunctionInfo
   were left without implementation in prior RTC SDK versions (like "TRtcRecord._Extract").
   This has now been fixed.

2) "Updates.txt" file has grown a bit large, so it was now split into V1, V2 and V3 files,
   each holding the list of updates released within a single RTC SDK major version cycle.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 362
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed XML-RPC support.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 361
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Exception logging added to destructors for all RealThinClient SDK classes.
   Should any exception be raised from a destructor of any RTC object and
   the LOG_AV_ERRORS global variable was TRUE or RTC_DEBUG compiler directive
   was declared, class name and exception message will be logged to the "ERROR" 
   log file and the exception will be re-raised (no exception hiding, only logging!).

2) Where possible, all "FREE" method calls have been replaced with "FreeAndNIL"
   to ensure that pointers to objects which should have been freed will be cleared,
   even if there was an exception in the object destructor (making the object unusable).

3) Added exception logging for most operations on RTC Value objects.
   Because not every exception raised from a RTC value object is an error,
   these exceptions will be logged to a separate "INFO" log file. To enable 
   logging of RTC value object exceptions, set the LOG_INFO_ERRORS global
   variable from the rtcInfo unit to TRUE, or declare the RTC_DEBUG directive.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 360
---------------------------------------------------------

1) RTC SDK Help file was missing the Search feature. This has now been fixed.
   (Thanks to "agSoft" for reporting this issue)

2) AppClient demo extended to allow changing of all parameters used in
   a flood test while the test is running. Now, a test does NOT need to 
   be stopped anymore to have a different test setting for the next loop.
   Every time a loop is over, all parameters will updated for the next one.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 359
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed all TPersistent descendant classes, as well as classes
   using these TPersistent descendants in their published properties.

   In prior RTC SDK version, some properties were NOT editable at design-time.
   For example, TRtcHttpClient was not storing changes made to UserLogin at design-time.
   

---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 358
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "isConnecting" method added to the TRtcClient component and all its 
   descendants (TRtcDataClient, TRtcHttpClient, TRtcMessageClient, etc)

   "isConnecting" will return TRUE if the connection is (A) currently connected, 
   or (B) preparing to connect, or (C) preparing to reconnect or (D) reconnecting.

2) "isIdle" method of the TRtcDataClient component fixed.

    "isIdle" will now also take in account the current connection status and 
    return TRUE if all requests have been sent or if "isConnecting" is FALSE.

3) "DoWaitForCompletion" method on the TRtcDataClient component fixed.

   "DoWaitForCompletion" is called by WaitForCompletion and WaitForCompletionEx methods 
   on TRtcDataClient and TRtcClientModule components, as well as the Execute method on
   the TRtcClientModule component (used for easy blocking remote function calls) and
   should wait for a complete response to be received from the Server, a timeout to 
   be exceeded (if specified), or an "irrepairable" connection error to happen. 

   In prior RTC SDK versions, WaitForCompletion would wait until the request queue
   was empty because all responses have been received or the request queue was cleared.
   And now, "WaitForCompletion" will also stop waiting for a response from the Server 
   if "isConnecting" returns FALSE, because that would also mean that there is no chance 
   any request left in the request queue will be sent, so there is no point in waiting.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 357
---------------------------------------------------------

1) OnResultError event was added to the TRtcClientModule component, which will be triggered in 
   case any unhandled exceptions get out of the OnResult event called after receiving the Result.

   If this event triggers, it means that your own code has raised an exception. You will get the 
   TRtcConnection object, Data and Result objects (TRtcValue) as well as the actual Exception raised.

   In prior RTC SDK versions, such exceptions would result in the OnResponseError event being 
   triggered, but that event is meant to be used only for capturing bad responses from the Server.

2) Added debug logging for the TRtcClientModule component. To enable it, declare the RTC_DEBUG compiler 
   directive or set the LOG_CLIENTMODULE_ERRORS global variable to TRUE (declared in "rtcCliModule" unit).


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 356
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed automatic reconnect implementation to make it possible to stop further reconnect attempts
   by using the Disconnect method. The problem in prior RTC SDK versions was that calling Disconnect 
   would have no effect if "ReconnectOn.ConnectFail" was TRUE and the Client was unable to Connect.

   Calling Disconnect before would only speed up the next reconnect attempt, but it would not have 
   stopped further connection attempts. This has now been fixed and Disconnect can now safely be
   used to cancel the current and any further Connect attempts - until calling Connect again.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 355
---------------------------------------------------------

1) More Multi-Threaded Client and Server Socket improvements.

2) App_Client and App_Server demos updated.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 354
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Improved exception handling for Client and Server Sockets in MultiThreaded mode.

2) Fixed a possible deadlock in Session cleanup (DoneSessions) used on Server shutdown.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 353
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Built-in RTC Encryption used with RTC remote functions and implemented on the
   TRtcClientModule and TRtcServerModule components has been optimized and extended 
   with support for fast encryption RESET (re-initialization without a full "handshake").

   Setting up a NEW encryption tunnel requires four (4) random keys to be exchanged by 
   the client and the server, for which two independent requests need to be sent from
   the client and two responses received from the Server (encryption setup handshake)
   before any user data can be sent or received. This takes time and consumes bandwidth,
   which means that setting up a new tunnel every time a connection is lost increases  
   traffic and further reduces performance, sometimes even causing data to never be sent.

   With any prior RTC SDK version, the Client has assumed everyting to be fine as long as
   the Server did NOT report a problem while trying to decrypt received data, the new 
   implementation will also assume the encryption tunnel is out-of-sync if a complete 
   request was sent from the Client but a full response was NOT receive from the Server.

   Also, if the encryption handshake was already completed before
 instead of starting
   a completely new encryption handshake and creating a new encryption tunnel, the Client 
   will now request the encryption tunnel to be "RESET" while sending the next remote call
   and will start encrypting its data as if the encryption handshake was just completed.

   That way, the Server will know if somewhing went wrong in the last request and will
   be able to silently reset its encryption state variables and start decrypting and 
   encrypting data without getting into a situation where decryption would stop working
   because the encryption channel was out-of-sync (caused by a connection loss). 
   As a result, the number of requests which would need to be resent on networks 
   with frequent connection loss (high packet loss) is reduced to a minimu.

   If the "onEncryptWrongKey" event triggers when the Client and the Server 
   are both compiled using this new RTC SDK version, the problem is either that:
   (A) Client is trying to use a different SecureKey than the Server, or 
   (B) Server was restarted after a successful encryption handshake was made, or 
   (C) Client's Session has expired on the Server (too short Session Life time?).


**********************************************************************
* IMPORTANT:
*
* To avoid negative side-effects using encryption in a network with old and new Clients,
* make sure to recompile and update the RTC Server first, before updating any RTC Clients.
*
* RTC Server compiled with the NEW RTC SDK version will continue working with Clients
* compiled with the OLD RTC SDK version, because it only adds support for "RESET".
* But ... RTC Client compiled with the NEW RTC SDK version will NOT work right with
* RTC Servers compiled with the OLD RTC SDK version, since the OLD Server does NOT
* implement the new "RESET" flag and will generate a "wrong encryption" response
* if a Client resets its encryption channel and requests the Server to do the same.
* The new RTC Client will try to cure this problem by sending a new "RESET", which 
* will again result in "wrong encryption" and will be repeated 3 times, after 
* which the Client would give up and ask for a new encryption handshake.
*
* Since this would happen only after 3 (three) unsuccessful "RESET" requests,
* while the OLD Client will immediately start a new handshake on "wrong encryption",
* a NEW RTC client will be working slower with the OLD Server than an OLD Client.
*
***********************************************************************

---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 352
---------------------------------------------------------

1) There was a bug in the Async WinSock implementation which became visible only
   when a very high number of frequent connects and disconnects were happening 
   and the connection was running in multi-threaded mode. The problem was that a 
   socket object could have been destroyed from one thread (because of a disconnect)
   while it was being accessed from another thread (processing a WinSock message).

   This has now been fixed, so that a socket object can not be destroyed by one 
   thread until it has been released from any other threads which might be using it.

2) There was another issue spotted in the Client-side HTTP/1.0 protocol implementation,
   where a Client could enter into a state where a connection would be closed after
   a successful response was received, but a new connection would not be opened unless 
   the AutoConnect property was set to TRUE, even if "ReconnectOn" properties were set 
   to keep a connection to the Server active and reconnect after each disconnect.

   This has now been fixed. Connections will now be closed after each response by the 
   Client using HTTP/1.0  the same way they are closed by the Server. This ensures that 
   properties set for "ReconnectOn" will apply to HTTP/1.0 just like they do for HTTP/1.1

---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 351
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Problems using the blocking client Socket provider with the old HTTP/1.0 protocol
   have been fixed, and the support for using the old HTTP/1.0 protocol was improved.

   NOTE: Because the old HTTP/1.0 protocol requires a connection to be closed after
   every single request/response, using the HTTP/1.0 protocol is NOT recommended
   and was implemented only for extreme cases where your client has to work with
   some very old Web Servers which do not support the new HTTP/1.1 protocol.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 350
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Async Socket close and release handling improved. Instead of posting a message
   to the socket window handle to have the socket object released at a later point
   in time, socket will be market for release and destroyed when existing the event
   which has market the socket for release (usually the "FD_CLOSE" message handler).

2) TRtcHttpServer fixed to correctly return a HTTP/1.0 response for HTTP/1.0 requests.

   In prior RTC SDK versions, a RTC Server would always send its resposes using the 
   new HTTP/1.1 protocol, even for requests received using the old HTTP/1.0 protocol.
   This could have caused problems with HTTP Clients which only understand HTTP/1.0 
   and expect to receive the text "HTTP/1.0" at the beginning of each response header.

3) RtcHttpClient component and all HTTP client connection providers have been 
   extended to also make it possible to send requests using the old HTTP/1.0 protocol
   in addition to the standard RTC implementation, which was always using HTTP/1.1

   To force a single request to be sent out using HTTP/1.0, set Request.Close:=TRUE
   for the request which you want to sent out using the old HTTP/1.0 protocol.

   To force ALL requests to be sent out using HTTP/1.0, use the new "ForceOldHttp10"
   property, which is now available on the TRtcHttpClient component (see below).

4) FixupRequest property available on the TRtcHttpClient component has been extended
   with a new "ForceOldHttp10" property, which you can set to TRUE if your client has
   to work with very Web Servers using the old HTTP/1.0 protocol.

   If your client needs to work with some very old Server(s) which ONLY understand the
   old HTTP/1.0 protocol and can NOT work with the new HTTP/1.1 protocol, you can either
   manually set the Request.Close property for every request to TRUE, or ... set
   FixupRequest.ForceOldHttp10:=TRUE to have every request sent out using HTTP/1.0.

   Setting ForceOldHttp10 to TRUE will force every request to be sent using HTTP/1.0,
   which means that a connection will be open before every request, one request will
   be sent out and a single response will be received before the Server closes the
   connection. The client will have to open a new connection if it wants to send
   out another request to the same Server. This will make your client work a lot
   slower, but will also make working with very old Web Servers a lot easier.

5) AppClient and File_Client demos extended to allow testing the use of the 
   newly added support for use of the old HTTP/1.0 in addition to HTTP/1.1

6) ClientUpload example in the QuickStart folder updated.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 349
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Rewritten the Low-level asynchronous (non-blocking) WinSock API access layer.

   After almost four years of NOT touching the low-level async WinSock connection 
   provider used by the TRtcHttpServer and TRtcHttpCient components in non-blocking 
   mode (default), it was time to re-visit that old unit and do some polishing.

   As a result, I've spent the past two weeks writing and testing a completely
   new implementation which strictly follows Microsoft recommendations (MSDN).

   And to minimize memory requirements for stand-alone RTC Servers, the new version
   is using RTC Huge Strings as in/out data buffers (just like the new blocking 
   WinSock API implementation), which reduces memory needs up to 64 KB per physical
   connection, while at the same time keeping the performance at the same level.

   The new implementation also provides detailed debug logging information,
   which now includes every event which could result in a conenction loss.

   To enable full RTC SDK debug logging in your project(s), you can simply 
   declare the RTC_DEBUG compiler directive in your project and *rebuild* it.

  *** !!! IMPORTANT !!! *********************************************************
  *
  *  This is the first RealThinClient SDK version which does NOT use third-party
  *  code for low-level socket access, but uses its own implementation which is
  *  optimized and designed specifically for use with the RealThinClient SDK.
  *
  *  Just like RTC SDK 3.46 - 3.48, this version was extensively stress-tested.
  *
  *  But, since even the smallest bug in the new implemenation using the async
  *  WinSock API could have rather bad effects on all stand-alone RTC Servers,
  *  despite the fact that the new code is clean, straight-forward and quite easy
  *  to understand and debug, and despite the fact that I have invested a lot of 
  *  time and effort to make sure the code is bug-free, I would understand it if
  *  someone who has mission-critical applications might decide to NOT use this
  *  new low-level async WinSock API access unit and would rather stick to the
  *  old and time-proven version, even if it does need more memory and has some
  *  problems under extreme load which have been eliminated in the new version.
  *
  *  So ... if you are NOT ready to start using the new low-level async WinSock
  *  access implementation, you will be able to find the old implementation from
  *  the RTC SDK version 3.48 in the "Lib/old" folder. To use the old code, all
  *  you need to do is copy the file "rtcWinSocket.pas" unit from the "Lib/old"
  *  folder over the file with the same name in the "Lib" folder. That's all.
  *
  *  Both units (the old and the new "rtcWinSocket.pas" version) implement the 
  *  TRtcWinSocket class which extends the TRtcSocketBase class and implements 
  *  all the methods used by higher-level RTC SDK connection providers. This is
  *  why these two units are inter-changeable (use which ever you like better).
  *
  *********************************************************************************

2) OnResponseDone event on the TRtcHttpServer component was not always triggering.
   This has been fixed and the OnResponseDone event will trigger for every response.

   The OnResponseDone event has only one purpose: traffic monitoring.


---------------------------------------------------------
* Build 348
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Third-party Encryption plugin interface has been optimized and the 
   SSL encryption plugin for StreamSec Tools II (v2.1.9.240+) was updated.

   The new TRtcCryptPlugin interface greatly improves communication between the 
   RTC SDK and the encryption plugin components (higher security and performance).

   *****************************************************************************
   * This and later RTC SDK versions will ONLY work with third-party encryption 
   * plugins (SSL) which have been updated to use the NEW RTC CryptPlugin interface.
   * Trying to compile older encryption plugin components will fail at compile time.
   **********************************************************************************

2) RTC Windows Handle Pool has been extended to allow using a fixed size pool of windows handles 
   instead of always using a single window handle. Since each handle is limited to 10.000 messages,
   using a single windows handle could get problematic when working with a few thousand connections.

   By default, the pool would be creating 5 handles for single-threaded use and 5 handles for 
   multi-threaded use, but since the window handle pool for multi-threaded use is created 
   on first use, the number of window handles for use in multi-threaded mode can be set at
   runtime by using the new RTC_THREAD_WINDOW_HANDLES global variable (rtcHWNDPool.pas unit)


   before the first call to Listen or Connect.

   The new windows handle pool will also use its own windows class and use a registration 
   procedure to register which procedure should be called for which message ranges,
   instead of registering different windos classes to be able to process messages 
   from different implementations using the pool (async WinSock API and Timers).

3) WinInet and WinHTTP API connection providers have been updated to reuse HTTP/S request 
   handles where possible, minimizing the number of unwanted re-connects when using SSL.

4) Response logging done by the App_Server has been extended (more info) and a new Timeouts
   checkbox was added to allow simple enabling/disabling of RTC Timeouts (set on app start).

5) App_Client demo has been extended to create a log file during its "Flood Test", 
   which is very similar to the log files being generated by the App_Server demo,
   with the difference that clients will count only correct and complete results
   while the Server counts all responses prepared for sending, even if they should
   not reach the client or if they were part of the encryption handshake.

6) Debug logging of RTC SDK events has now been organized into separate files,
   each file grouping a specific type of an event. This makes it easier to spot
   possible errors simply by checking which log files were created, without having 
   to scan the whole log file to see if there are errors or only hints and warning.

   To enable full debug logging of the RTC SDK, you now only have to declare the  
   RTC_DEBUG compiler directive for your project. This will enable general logging
   for RTC SDK unit initialization and finalization, as well as logging of all  
   "events of interest" by setting all "LOG_..." variables to TRUE by default.

   NOTE: All log files created by logging inside the RTC SDK are informational
   and are used for debugging the RTC SDK, but the majority of them are expected
   to happen (like SOCK errors, for example) and do not necessarily have to be 
   an indication of a problem or a bug in the RTC SDK, with the exception of
   log entries which end up in the log file ending with "ERROR.log", 
   where all exceptions will be logged which should never happen.

   If you only want to enable logging of critical errors and do not need nor want
   to log things like connection losses or timeout events, instead of declaring
   the RTC_DEBUG compiler directive, you should set LOG_AV_ERRORS:=TRUE;
