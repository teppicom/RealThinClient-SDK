---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.28 (2013.Q4)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) TRtcQuickJob component extended with a "Serialized" property,
   making the component work as a serialized job queue, where jobs 
   will be executed one at a time (serialized=True) instead of parallel.

2) TRtcQuickJob component extended with a "Stop" method, which can be called before 
   destroying the component to stop triggering events already posted into the queue.

3) Fixed a coflict with Auto-Reference-Counting in the NextGen compiler for Mobile platforms (Delphi XE4 and XE5), 
   which was causing random Access Violations when RTC Timers or Timeouts were used (affects iOS and Android Apps).

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.27
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "GateChatClient" Demo extended with a simple "White-board" feature.

   Now, all participants in a Chat Room will share a White-board,
   which can be used by everyone for freehand drawing. 

   This new feature demonstrates fast sending and receiving of small packages.

   When a user is drawing on the White-board, messages are sent to the Gateway
   and dispatched to all Clients in the Group, then used by each Client to
   update their drawing in near-real-time. All users can draw on the White-board
   at the same time, without interference from other users. It's like sharing
   a Canvas. Each user has its own Pen and uses it to draw on the shared Canvas.

   Drawing data is kept in an in-memory DataSet by each Client, keeping 
   memory usage low, even when there are a lot of Chat Rooms with White-boards open.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.26
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Local User Group management methods on the TRtcHttpGateClient component
   updated to allow concurrent calls from multiple threads.

2) Removed a call to "ReleaseAllGroupIDs" from the User Login method,
   to allow the Client to use the same Group IDs with a new User ID.
   Call the "ReleaseAllGroupIDs" method manually when GroupIDs should be released.

3) Gateway Test Projects moved from "Demos\RTC_Gateway" to "Demos\GatewayTest" folder.

4) Two new Demos added: "GateChatClient" and "GateChatServer".

   These two Demos use the new TRtcGateway, TRtcHttpGateClient and TRtcGateClientLink
   components to implement a simple Chat Server and Chat Client where each Client can
   open multiple Chat Rooms and invite other Clients to a group Chat. Notifications
   are sent from the Gateway to Chat Clients when other Clients become available or 
   unavailable, and ChatClients are using this info to update their "USERS ONLINE" List.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.25
---------------------------------------------------------

1) TRtcGateway, TRtcHttpGateClient and TRtcGateClientLink components added.

   * TRtcGateway component provides a new "Gateway" implementation, which allows 
     thousands of Clients using TRtcHttpGateClient components to communicate "directly".
     
     The only requirement for a Client to send messages to another Client is to know
     the UserID of the receiving Client. Clients can also form their own Groups of 
     Clients and dispatch messages to the whole Group, while sending data to the 
     Gateway only once. Notifications are sent from the Gateway when a Client joins or 
     leaves a group. All clients are automatically removed from other Clients groups 
     if they lose connection to the Gateway, with notifications sent to active Clients.
     
     Events can be used on the Gateway for custom user authentication and group management.
     For example, Gateway can check user credentials on login (see "BeforeLoginEvent")
     and notify Clients when other Clients become available or unavailable
     (check "OnUserReady" and "OnUserNotReady" events). Because Clients only need
     the UserID of another Client for direct communication, any data other than 
     the UserID can easily be exchanged between Clients directly, after receiving the 
     "UserJoined" or "JoinedUser" notification from the Gateway.

   * TRtcHttpGateClient component implements Client-side communication for sending
     and receiving messages from other Clients connected to the same Gateway.

   * One or more TRtcGateClientLink components can be attached to a 
     TRtcHttpGateClient component to separate your code into different modules.

2) New "rtcSDK_Gate" package introduced for registration of Gateway-related components.
   Check the "RTC Gate" tab in the component palette after component registration.

3) "SDKDemos_VCL_Gate" Project Group added with 2 Projects, 
   which can be used for testing the new Gateway-related components:

   * RTC_Gateway\RtcSimpleGateway.dpr is a simple Server using a TRtcGateway component.

   * RTC_Gateway\RtcGateTestClient.dpr is a simple Gate Client for testing basic 
     Gateway functionality. It can use UDP for dispatching messages to local Clients
     and link them to work as a group, so that multiple instances can be started
     and controlled at the same time to simplify stress-testing.
