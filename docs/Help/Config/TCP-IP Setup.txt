IPEnableRouter 

Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
Value Type: REG_DWORD - Boolean
Valid Range: 0 or 1 (False or True)
Default: 0 (False)

Description: Setting this parameter to 1 (True) causes the computer to route IP packets between the networks that it is connected to. 

------------

DefaultTTL 

Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
Value Type: REG_DWORD - Number of
seconds/hops
Valid Range: 1-255
Default: 128 for Windows XP

Description: This parameter specifies the default Time To Live (TTL) value that is set in the header of outgoing IP packets. 
The TTL determines the maximum time that an IP packet can live in the network without reaching its destination. 
It is effectively a limit on the number of routers an IP packet can pass through before it is discarded.

ForwardBufferMemory 

Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
Value Type: REG_DWORD - Number of bytes
Valid Range: network MTU - some reasonable
value smaller than 0xFFFFFFFF 
Default: 74240 (sufficient for fifty 1480-byte
packets, rounded to a multiple of 256)

Description: This parameter determines how much memory IP allocates to store packet data in the router packet queue. 
When this buffer space is filled, the router starts to discard packets at random from its queue. 
Packet queue data buffers are 256 bytes in length. Therefore, the value of this parameter must be a multiple of 256. 
Multiple buffers are chained together for larger packets. The IP header for a packet is stored separately. 
This parameter is ignored and no buffers are allocated if the IP router is not enabled. 

------------

NumForwardPackets 

Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
Value Type: REG_DWORD Number
Valid Range: 1 - some reasonable value
smaller than 0xFFFFFFFF Default: 50

Description: This parameter determines the number of IP packet headers that are allocated for the router packet queue. 
When all headers are in use, the router begins to discard packets at random from the queue. 
This value should be at least as large as the ForwardBufferMemory value divided by the maximum IP data size 
of the networks that are connected to the router. This value must be no larger than the ForwardBufferMemory value divided 
by 256 because at least 256 bytes of forward buffer memory are used for each packet. The optimal number of forward packets 
for a particular ForwardBufferMemory size depends on the type of traffic that is carried on the network and will be 
somewhere between these two values. This parameter is ignored and no headers are allocated if the router is not enabled. 

------------

TcpMaxConnectRetransmissions 

Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
Value Type: REG_DWORD - Number
Valid Range: 0 - 0xFFFFFFFF
Default: 2

Description: This parameter determines the number of times that TCP retransmits a connect request (SYN) before aborting the attempt. 
The retransmission timeout is doubled with each successive retransmission in a particular connect attempt. 
The initial timeout value is three seconds. 

------------

TcpMaxDataRetransmissions 

Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
Value Type: REG_DWORD - Number
Valid Range: 0 - 0xFFFFFFFF
Default: 5

Description: This parameter controls the number of times that TCP retransmits an individual data segment (non-connect segment) 
before it aborts the connection. The retransmission timeout is doubled with each successive retransmission on a connection. 
It is reset when responses resume. The base timeout value is dynamically determined by the measured round-trip time on the connection. 

------------

TcpTimedWaitDelay 

Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
Value Type: REG_DWORD - Time in seconds
Valid Range: 30-300 (decimal)
Default: 0xF0 (240 decimal)

Description: This parameter determines the time that a connection stays in the TIME_WAIT state when it is closing. 
While a connection is in the TIME_WAIT state, the socket pair cannot be re-used. This is also known as the "2MSL" state. 
According to RFC, the value should be two times the maximum segment lifetime on the network. See RFC793 for more details.

-------------

TcpWindowSize 
Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
Value Type: REG_DWORD - Number of bytes
Valid Range: 0 - 0xFFFF
Default: The smaller of 0xFFFF
         OR
(The larger of four times the maximum TCP data size on the network
         OR
8192 rounded up to an even multiple of the network TCP data size.)
The default is 8760 for Ethernet.

Description: This parameter determines the maximum TCP receive window size of the computer. 
The receive window specifies the number of bytes a sender can transmit without receiving an acknowledgment. 
Generally, larger receive windows improve performance over high (delay * bandwidth) networks. 
For highest efficiency, the receive window must be an even multiple of the TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS).
